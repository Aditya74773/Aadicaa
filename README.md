# Importance of Git History
Git history is crucial in version control and debugging as it allows developers to:
- Track changes over time.
- Identify when and why modifications were made.
- Revert to previous versions if needed.
- Collaborate effectively with a team.
- Debug issues by pinpointing faulty commits.
